#RREF in python using Gaussian elimination
This is a school project. While we do intend to optimize as much as possible, do not expect it to outperform anything.

##To-do list
* [DONE]Row-Swapping/check for 0 at first element AND d(2,2), d(3,3) and so on
* [DONE]Check for invalid dimensions
* [DONE]Clean up test-code
* [DONE]Add comments about what everything does
* Make the end result of rref-matrix look pretty
* Matrices with more rows than columns ought to work
* Input function should test if input is valid
