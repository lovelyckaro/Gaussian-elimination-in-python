# RREF in python using Gaussian elimination #
This is a school project. While we do intend to optimize as much as possible, do not expect it to outperform anything.

## To-do list ##
* Actually implement Gaussian elimination correctly
* RREF should work whether or not the dimensions are valid, both too tall and too wide matrices should work
* Stylized outputs of matrices before and after the operation
* ~~Input function should test if input is valid~~
